Calculus Assignment: Advanced Derivatives

Problem 1: Find the derivative of f(x) = x³ · ln(x) using the product rule.

Solution:
Let u = x³ and v = ln(x)
u' = 3x² and v' = 1/x

Using the product rule: (uv)' = u'v + uv'
f'(x) = 3x² · ln(x) + x³ · (1/x)
f'(x) = 3x² ln(x) + x²
f'(x) = x²(3ln(x) + 1)

Problem 2: Evaluate the definite integral ∫₀¹ xe^x dx using integration by parts.

Solution:
Let u = x, dv = e^x dx
Then du = dx, v = e^x

Using integration by parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du
∫₀¹ xe^x dx = [xe^x]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ e^x dx
= [xe^x]₀¹ - [e^x]₀¹
= (1·e¹ - 0·e⁰) - (e¹ - e⁰)
= e - (e - 1)
= 1

Problem 3: Find the limit lim(x→0) (sin(x) - x)/x³ using L'Hôpital's rule.

This is a complex multivariable calculus problem requiring advanced techniques.
