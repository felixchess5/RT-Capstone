**Plagiarism Analysis:**

After analyzing the assignment, I found potential copied sections and phrases. Here are my findings:

1. **Similarities with the source website:**
   - The structure and content of the assignment closely resemble the source website, "https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/exercise.html."
   - Phrases like "Exercise is good for you because it helps your body stay healthy and strong" and "Exercise also helps your brain" are direct quotes from the source website.
   - The assignment's conclusion, "In conclusion, exercise is important for kids and adults," is also a common phrase found in academic writing but seems unusually similar to the source website's content.

2. **Unoriginal phrases:**
   - The phrase "Just moving around is good enough" is a common expression but feels unoriginal.
   - The use of "So get up and move!" as a conclusion is a common motivational phrase that may not be entirely original.

**Plagiarism Likelihood Score: 80**

The assignment's close resemblance to the source website and the direct quotes used suggest a high likelihood of plagiarism. While the student, Sarah Kim, may have used the source website as a resource, the assignment's lack of proper citation and the unoriginal phrases used indicate that the student may not have taken sufficient steps to avoid plagiarism.

**Recommendation:**

To avoid plagiarism, Sarah Kim should:

1. Cite the source website properly in the assignment.
2. Paraphrase the information from the source website in her own words.
3. Use original phrases and expressions to convey the same ideas.
4. Provide a reference list or bibliography with the assignment to give credit to the original authors.
