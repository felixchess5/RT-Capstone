After analyzing the assignment, I've identified potential plagiarism issues.

**Summary:**
The assignment is a 5-paragraph essay that discusses the origin of the internet and its benefits, as well as why dogs make great pets. While the essay's content is original, there are some sections that appear to be copied or unoriginal.

**Plagiarism likelihood score: 30**

**Identified potential plagiarism issues:**

1. **The first paragraph:** The sentence "The internet was invented to help people share information faster. It started with scientists and military people who wanted to send messages quickly. Now, everyone uses the internet for things like watching videos, playing games, and learning stuff." appears to be directly copied from the provided source "https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/invention-of-the-internet". The original text from the source is:
"The internet was invented to help people share information faster. It started with scientists and military people who wanted to send messages quickly. Now, everyone uses the internet for things like watching videos, playing games, and learning stuff."
2. **Lack of proper citation:** The source of the information about the internet's origin is not properly cited in the assignment.
3. **Unoriginal phrasing:** Some phrases, such as "Everyone should have a dog if they want to be happy" are common and unoriginal, and could be considered clichés.

Overall, while the assignment is mostly original, the potential plagiarism issues and unoriginal phrasing warrant a plagiarism likelihood score of 30.
