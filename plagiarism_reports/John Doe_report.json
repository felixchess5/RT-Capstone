**Summary of Findings:**

After analyzing the assignment, I found that the text appears to be largely original, but it does contain some sections that are similar to the source material provided. The similarity suggests that the student may have relied heavily on the source article, potentially copying or paraphrasing certain phrases without proper citation.

**Identified Potential Plagiarism:**

1. **Section 1:** The first paragraph, "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our world today. It refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. These actions release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet."

   This section is almost identical to the source article, with the same sentence structure, wording, and even the same example (burning fossil fuels). While it's not a direct copy-paste, the similarity is striking.

2. **Section 3:** The third paragraph, "Humans are also affected. Farmers struggle with unpredictable growing seasons, and heatwaves pose health risks, especially to the elderly and young children. Climate change can even lead to economic instability, as countries spend more on disaster recovery and healthcare."

   This section also shows significant similarity to the source article, with the same structure, wording, and examples (unpredictable growing seasons, heatwaves, and economic instability).

3. **Conclusion:** The conclusion, "In conclusion, climate change is a global challenge that demands urgent action. By understanding its causes and effects, and by making sustainable choices, we can protect our planet for future generations."

   This section is a common conclusion phrase and is not unique to the source article, but it still lacks originality and could be seen as borrowed from the source.

**Plagiarism Likelihood Score: 60**

While the assignment is not a direct copy-paste, the similarities between the text and the source article suggest that the student may have relied too heavily on the source material. To avoid plagiarism, the student should have paraphrased and cited the source material more thoroughly, adding their own original thoughts and ideas to the text.
