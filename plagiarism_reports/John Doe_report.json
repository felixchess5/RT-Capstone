**Plagiarism Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the assignment, I found several sections that appear to be copied or unoriginal. Here are the identified phrases and sections:

1. **Opening sentence:** "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our world today." This sentence is a common introductory phrase found in many climate change articles and reports, including the source cited (National Geographic).
2. **Explanation of climate change causes:** "These actions release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet." This sentence is a direct paraphrase of the National Geographic article, which states: "Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet."
3. **Consequences of climate change:** The paragraph describing the consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and polar ice caps melting, is similar to the National Geographic article. While the language is slightly rephrased, the content is largely identical.
4. **Effects on humans:** The paragraph discussing the effects of climate change on humans, including farmers struggling with unpredictable growing seasons and heatwaves posing health risks, is also similar to the National Geographic article.
5. **Solutions to combat climate change:** The paragraph outlining ways to reduce our carbon footprint, including using renewable energy sources and conserving energy, is a common solution listed in many climate change articles and reports.
6. **Conclusion:** The final sentence, "By understanding its causes and effects, and by making sustainable choices, we can protect our planet for future generations," is a generic conclusion that could be found in many climate change assignments or articles.

**Plagiarism Likelihood Score:** 70/100

The assignment appears to be heavily influenced by the National Geographic article, with several sections being direct paraphrases or copied verbatim. While the student has attempted to rephrase some of the language, the content is largely identical to the source material. To avoid plagiarism, the student should have provided more original analysis and insights or properly cited the source material.
