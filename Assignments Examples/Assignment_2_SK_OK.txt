Why Exercise Is Good For You
Exercise is good for you because it helps your body stay healthy and strong. When you do exercise, your heart beats faster and your muscles gets stronger. It also helps you feel better and have more energy during the day.
There are many kinds of exercise. Running, swimming, and playing sports are all good ways to get moving. Even walking or riding a bike to school is a good exercise. You don’t have to be a athlete to do it. Just moving around is good enough.
Exercise also helps your brain. When you move, your brain gets more blood and oxygen, which helps you think better. It can also make you feel happy because your body makes chemicals called endorphins that make you feel good.
Kids should try to exercise every day. It don’t have to be hard or long. Just 30 minutes of playing outside or dancing to music can help a lot. If you sit too much, like watching TV or playing video games all day, it’s not good for your health.
In conclusion, exercise is important for kids and adults. It keeps your body strong, your mind sharp, and helps you feel happy. So get up and move!
