Lab Report: Acid-Base Titration

Hypothesis:
I predict that if I titrate a 0.1 M NaOH solution with 0.1 M HCl, then the equivalence point will occur at exactly 25 mL of HCl because the molarity and volume of both solutions should be equal for complete neutralization.

Materials:
- 0.1 M NaOH solution
- 0.1 M HCl solution
- Phenolphthalein indicator
- Burette (50 mL)
- Conical flask (250 mL)
- Pipette (25 mL)
- Retort stand and clamp

Procedure:
1. Set up the burette in the retort stand and fill with 0.1 M HCl
2. Pipette 25.0 mL of 0.1 M NaOH into the conical flask
3. Add 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the NaOH solution
4. Record the initial burette reading
5. Slowly add HCl from the burette while swirling the flask
6. Stop when the pink color disappears permanently
7. Record the final burette reading
8. Repeat the titration 3 times for accuracy

Observations:
Trial 1: Initial reading 0.0 mL, Final reading 24.8 mL, Volume used: 24.8 mL
Trial 2: Initial reading 0.0 mL, Final reading 25.1 mL, Volume used: 25.1 mL
Trial 3: Initial reading 0.0 mL, Final reading 24.9 mL, Volume used: 24.9 mL

Results:
Average volume of HCl used: 24.9 mL
The pink color disappeared at the endpoint, indicating neutralization.

Conclusion:
My hypothesis was largely correct. The average volume of HCl needed was 24.9 mL, which is very close to my predicted 25.0 mL. The slight difference (0.1 mL) could be due to experimental error such as reading the meniscus incorrectly or adding acid too quickly near the endpoint. The neutralization reaction follows the equation:

NaOH + HCl â†’ NaCl + H2O

This confirms that equal molar amounts of acid and base are needed for complete neutralization when the concentrations are equal.

Safety Considerations:
- Wore safety goggles and gloves throughout the experiment
- Used fume hood when handling acid solutions
- Disposed of waste solutions properly in designated containers
