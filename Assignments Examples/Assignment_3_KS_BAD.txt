The Internet and Why Dogs Are Great Pets
The internet was invented to help people share information faster. It started with scientists and military people who wanted to send messages quickly. Now, everyone uses the internet for things like watching videos, playing games, and learning stuff.
Dogs are great pets because they are loyal and friendly. They can help people feel less lonely and are fun to play with. Some dogs are trained to help people with disabilities, like guide dogs for blind people. They also protect homes and bark when strangers come.
Even though the internet is cool, dogs are better because they are alive and can love you back. You can’t hug the internet, but you can hug a dog. Dogs don’t need Wi-Fi and they don’t crash like websites do.
In summary, the internet changed the world, but dogs are still the best friends you can have. Everyone should have a dog if they want to be happy.
