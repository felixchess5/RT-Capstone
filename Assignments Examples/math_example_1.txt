Quadratic Functions and Their Applications

Problem Set 1: Solving Quadratic Equations

1. Solve for x: 2x² + 7x - 15 = 0

Step 1: Identify coefficients
a = 2, b = 7, c = -15

Step 2: Use the quadratic formula
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

Step 3: Substitute values
x = [-7 ± √(7² - 4(2)(-15))] / 2(2)
x = [-7 ± √(49 + 120)] / 4
x = [-7 ± √169] / 4
x = [-7 ± 13] / 4

Step 4: Find both solutions
x₁ = (-7 + 13) / 4 = 6/4 = 3/2
x₂ = (-7 - 13) / 4 = -20/4 = -5

Therefore: x = 3/2 or x = -5

2. Solve by factoring: x² - 5x - 24 = 0

Step 1: Find two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to -5
The numbers are -8 and +3 because: (-8)(3) = -24 and -8 + 3 = -5

Step 2: Factor the equation
x² - 5x - 24 = (x - 8)(x + 3) = 0

Step 3: Apply zero product property
x - 8 = 0  or  x + 3 = 0
x = 8  or  x = -3

Problem Set 2: Graphing Quadratic Functions

3. Graph the function f(x) = x² - 4x + 3

Step 1: Find the vertex
x-coordinate of vertex: x = -b/2a = -(-4)/2(1) = 4/2 = 2
y-coordinate of vertex: f(2) = (2)² - 4(2) + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1
Vertex: (2, -1)

Step 2: Find the y-intercept
f(0) = (0)² - 4(0) + 3 = 3
Y-intercept: (0, 3)

Step 3: Find the x-intercepts (set f(x) = 0)
x² - 4x + 3 = 0
(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0
x = 3 or x = 1
X-intercepts: (1, 0) and (3, 0)

Step 4: Determine additional points
f(-1) = (-1)² - 4(-1) + 3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8
f(4) = (4)² - 4(4) + 3 = 16 - 16 + 3 = 3

The parabola opens upward (a > 0) with vertex at (2, -1).

Problem Set 3: Word Problems

4. A projectile is launched upward with an initial velocity of 64 ft/s from a height of 6 feet. The height h (in feet) after t seconds is given by:
h(t) = -16t² + 64t + 6

a) What is the maximum height reached by the projectile?

Step 1: Find the time when maximum height occurs
t = -b/2a = -64/2(-16) = 64/32 = 2 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the maximum height
h(2) = -16(2)² + 64(2) + 6
h(2) = -16(4) + 128 + 6
h(2) = -64 + 128 + 6 = 70 feet

The maximum height is 70 feet.

b) When does the projectile hit the ground?

Step 1: Set h(t) = 0
-16t² + 64t + 6 = 0

Step 2: Divide by -2 to simplify
8t² - 32t - 3 = 0

Step 3: Use the quadratic formula
t = [32 ± √(32² - 4(8)(-3))] / 2(8)
t = [32 ± √(1024 + 96)] / 16
t = [32 ± √1120] / 16
t = [32 ± 33.47] / 16

Step 4: Find positive solution (time cannot be negative)
t₁ = (32 + 33.47) / 16 ≈ 4.09 seconds
t₂ = (32 - 33.47) / 16 ≈ -0.09 seconds (reject)

The projectile hits the ground after approximately 4.09 seconds.

Problem Set 4: Systems with Quadratics

5. Solve the system:
y = x² - 2x + 1
y = 2x - 1

Step 1: Set the equations equal
x² - 2x + 1 = 2x - 1

Step 2: Rearrange to standard form
x² - 2x + 1 - 2x + 1 = 0
x² - 4x + 2 = 0

Step 3: Use the quadratic formula
x = [4 ± √(16 - 8)] / 2 = [4 ± √8] / 2 = [4 ± 2√2] / 2 = 2 ± √2

Step 4: Find corresponding y-values
For x = 2 + √2: y = 2(2 + √2) - 1 = 4 + 2√2 - 1 = 3 + 2√2
For x = 2 - √2: y = 2(2 - √2) - 1 = 4 - 2√2 - 1 = 3 - 2√2

Solutions: (2 + √2, 3 + 2√2) and (2 - √2, 3 - 2√2)
