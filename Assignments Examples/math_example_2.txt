Derivatives and Applications

Problem 1: Basic Differentiation

Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x⁴ - 2x³ + 5x² - 7x + 2

Solution:
Using the power rule: d/dx[xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹

f'(x) = d/dx[3x⁴] - d/dx[2x³] + d/dx[5x²] - d/dx[7x] + d/dx[2]
f'(x) = 3(4x³) - 2(3x²) + 5(2x) - 7(1) + 0
f'(x) = 12x³ - 6x² + 10x - 7

Problem 2: Product Rule

Find the derivative of g(x) = (2x + 1)(x² - 3x + 4)

Solution:
Using the product rule: d/dx[u·v] = u'v + uv'

Let u = 2x + 1 and v = x² - 3x + 4
u' = 2
v' = 2x - 3

g'(x) = u'v + uv'
g'(x) = 2(x² - 3x + 4) + (2x + 1)(2x - 3)
g'(x) = 2x² - 6x + 8 + (2x + 1)(2x - 3)
g'(x) = 2x² - 6x + 8 + 4x² - 6x + 2x - 3
g'(x) = 6x² - 10x + 5

Problem 3: Chain Rule

Find the derivative of h(x) = (3x² - 2x + 1)⁵

Solution:
Using the chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)

Let u = 3x² - 2x + 1, so h(x) = u⁵
du/dx = 6x - 2
dh/du = 5u⁴

h'(x) = dh/du · du/dx
h'(x) = 5u⁴ · (6x - 2)
h'(x) = 5(3x² - 2x + 1)⁴ · (6x - 2)
h'(x) = (30x - 10)(3x² - 2x + 1)⁴

Problem 4: Quotient Rule

Find the derivative of k(x) = (x² + 1)/(x - 2)

Solution:
Using the quotient rule: d/dx[u/v] = (u'v - uv')/v²

Let u = x² + 1 and v = x - 2
u' = 2x
v' = 1

k'(x) = (u'v - uv')/v²
k'(x) = [2x(x - 2) - (x² + 1)(1)]/(x - 2)²
k'(x) = [2x² - 4x - x² - 1]/(x - 2)²
k'(x) = [x² - 4x - 1]/(x - 2)²

Problem 5: Related Rates

A spherical balloon is being inflated at a rate of 20 cubic inches per minute. How fast is the radius increasing when the radius is 5 inches?

Solution:
Given: dV/dt = 20 in³/min
Find: dr/dt when r = 5 inches

Step 1: Write the volume formula for a sphere
V = (4/3)πr³

Step 2: Differentiate both sides with respect to time
dV/dt = d/dt[(4/3)πr³]
dV/dt = (4/3)π · 3r² · dr/dt
dV/dt = 4πr² · dr/dt

Step 3: Solve for dr/dt
dr/dt = dV/dt / (4πr²)

Step 4: Substitute known values
dr/dt = 20 / (4π(5)²)
dr/dt = 20 / (4π · 25)
dr/dt = 20 / (100π)
dr/dt = 1/(5π) ≈ 0.0637 inches per minute

Problem 6: Optimization

A rectangular box with a square base and no top is to be made from 108 square feet of cardboard. Find the dimensions that give the maximum volume.

Solution:
Let x = side length of square base
Let h = height of box

Step 1: Set up constraints
Surface area = x² + 4xh = 108
Therefore: h = (108 - x²)/(4x)

Step 2: Express volume as a function of x
V = x²h = x² · (108 - x²)/(4x)
V(x) = x(108 - x²)/4 = (108x - x³)/4

Step 3: Find the derivative
V'(x) = (108 - 3x²)/4

Step 4: Set derivative equal to zero
(108 - 3x²)/4 = 0
108 - 3x² = 0
3x² = 108
x² = 36
x = 6 feet (taking positive value)

Step 5: Find corresponding height
h = (108 - 36)/(4 · 6) = 72/24 = 3 feet

Step 6: Verify this is a maximum using second derivative test
V''(x) = -6x/4 = -3x/2
V''(6) = -3(6)/2 = -9 < 0

Since V''(6) < 0, this is indeed a maximum.

The optimal dimensions are:
Base: 6 feet × 6 feet
Height: 3 feet
Maximum volume: V = 6² × 3 = 108 cubic feet
