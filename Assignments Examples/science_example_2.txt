Newton's Second Law Investigation

Question: How does the acceleration of an object change when different forces are applied to it while keeping the mass constant?

Hypothesis: Based on Newton's second law (F = ma), I predict that acceleration will be directly proportional to the applied force when mass remains constant.

Materials:
- Dynamics cart (mass = 0.5 kg)
- String and pulley system
- Masses (0.1 kg, 0.2 kg, 0.3 kg, 0.4 kg)
- Motion sensor
- Computer with data collection software
- Meter stick

Procedure:
1. Set up the cart on a horizontal track with motion sensor
2. Attach string to cart, run over pulley at end of track
3. Start with 0.1 kg hanging mass to provide force
4. Release cart and measure acceleration using motion sensor
5. Record data for 5 trials with each mass
6. Repeat with 0.2 kg, 0.3 kg, and 0.4 kg hanging masses
7. Calculate average acceleration for each force

Data Table:
Force (N) | Trial 1 (m/s²) | Trial 2 (m/s²) | Trial 3 (m/s²) | Trial 4 (m/s²) | Trial 5 (m/s²) | Average (m/s²)
0.98      | 1.92           | 1.96           | 1.94           | 1.98           | 1.95           | 1.95
1.96      | 3.89           | 3.92           | 3.88           | 3.94           | 3.91           | 3.91
2.94      | 5.85           | 5.88           | 5.82           | 5.90           | 5.87           | 5.86
3.92      | 7.80           | 7.84           | 7.78           | 7.86           | 7.82           | 7.82

Analysis:
When I graph force vs. acceleration, I get a straight line with slope ≈ 2.0 m/s²/N. Since F = ma, the slope should equal 1/m. With our cart mass of 0.5 kg, the theoretical slope is 1/0.5 = 2.0 m/s²/N. This matches our experimental result perfectly!

The relationship F = ma is clearly demonstrated. When force doubles from 0.98 N to 1.96 N, acceleration doubles from 1.95 m/s² to 3.91 m/s².

Conclusion:
The experimental data strongly supports Newton's second law. The linear relationship between force and acceleration confirms that F = ma when mass is constant. The slight variations in individual trials are likely due to friction and air resistance, but the overall trend is clear.

Sources of Error:
- Friction in pulley system
- Air resistance
- Measurement precision of motion sensor
- String stretch during acceleration
